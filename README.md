# Java-program-for-defining-Class-and-Object
The program defines a Dog class with a name attribute and two methods: setName to assign a name to the dog, and displayName to print the dog's name. In the Main class, an object myDog is created, its name is set to "Buddy" using setName and then displayed using displayName. This demonstrates basic class and object usage in Java.
